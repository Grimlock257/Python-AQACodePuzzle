Introduction

Coursework 1 for GCSE Computer Science 2015. No dependencies other than Python.


Problem Specification

We had to create a program in Python which presented the user with a list of encrypted words (from a provided text file), it that had to carry out 3 'clues' (pre-given letter/cipher text pairings) on the list containing the encrypted words. The aim was for the user to guess what each symbol was and pair it with a letter in order to decode the words.


My Solution

My solution for the coursework included an extra feature which was performing and displaying frequency of each of the symbols that appear in the cipher text.
