# Introduction
This was coursework 1 for GCSE Computer Science that I completed in 2015. This project has no dependencies other than Python.

The code uploaded is exactly as I left it in 2015 (other than I fixed a few typos in the comments - of which I don't know why I made so many for practically every line of code!)

# Problem Specification
We had to create a program in Python which presented the user with a list of encrypted words (from a provided text file), it that had to carry out 3 'clues' (pre-given letter/cipher text pairings) on the list containing the encrypted words. The aim was for the user to guess what each symbol was and pair it with a letter in order to decode the words.

# My Solution
My solution for the coursework included an extra feature which was performing and displaying frequency of each of the symbols that appear in the cipher text.

#### Demo
